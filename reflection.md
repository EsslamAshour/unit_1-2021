# Q2. Purpose of the success criteria
In order to make sure your project meets all conditions defined by the client and also general project standards.

# Q3
That it mostly depends on changing your way of thinking and not memorizing code syntax or using it.
A more formal approach to development and more importance on testing.

# Q4
I learned that I'm too much of a perfectionist, and I aim to make every part of my project perfect otherwise I would be unsatisifed. I also learned that I need more organization skills.

# Q5
The development stage was the most fun part for me and I did well in it.

# Q6
My testing was not enough, mainly because of misunderstanding the project criteria and not having enough time. I did not test that much features from the project.

# Q8
I think it depends on the type of project. If the project is a web app for example, or a project that just needs maintenance and updating, then the developer should be responsible for that.
But if the project is one like ours, where it's not connected to any other frameworks or apps, the developer should not be responsible for anything after flufilling the success criteria.
