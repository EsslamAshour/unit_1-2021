# Question 1

I think it would be better to involve the client during the process. For example, everytime we finish a major version in the product (Like alpha/beta in games), we can show it to the client and get their feedback/suggestions. This way we can have client feedback through the whole development process instead of only when releasing the end product, guarantee the client will be satisifed with the end product and reduce overall development time.

# Question 2

Yes. For my game an MVP would be a primitive version of the game with basic functions, and then using client feedback/suggestions and original criteria I can develop it further by modifying/adding more functions, and then consider that an MVP, and so on.

# Question 3

- In both you observe your audience in order to know what is needed.
- *Idea generation* and *planning* in are similar, as both include coming up with a solution.
- *Prototyping* and *design* are similar, as in both stages we create a model for the product.
- In both cycles there's a testing stage.


# Question 4

- **Discoverability**: discovering what operations you can do on something by just looking at it, without needing manual instructions.
- **Feedback**: informing the human of what operation they did and what that operation did.


# Question 5

- When the user does a certain action (like attacking/blocking the enemy in my game) the program will print what the user did and what the action did (how much damage the attack dealt/ whether the block succeeded or not / the enemy's HP)
