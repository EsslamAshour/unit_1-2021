# Question 1

I think it would be better to involve the client during the process. For example, everytime we finish a major version in the product (Like alpha/beta in games), we can show it to the client and get their feedback/suggestions.

# Question 2

Yes. For my game an MVP would be a primitive version of the game with basic functions, and then using client feedback/suggestions and original criteria I can develop it further by modifying/adding more functions, and then consider that an MVP, and so on.
